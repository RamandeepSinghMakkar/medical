## **1. Medical NLP Summarization**

**Task:** Implement an NLP pipeline to **extract medical details** from the transcribed conversation.

NER: Implemented using Groq Llama3-70B API for highly accurate extraction.
Keyword Extraction: Done using spaCy and KeyBERT (sentence-transformers model used).
Summarization: Done using BART (facebook/bart-large-cnn) Transformer-based summarization.

For reference:
For given sample text in the Assignemnt:
<img width="638" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e27ebb3d-56df-4924-9158-6fc0376fdcf8" />

Suppose for given text
Patient â€“ Good afternoon, Doctor.
Doctor â€“ Good afternoon Rahul. How can I assist you today?
Patient â€“ I have been feeling constantly thirsty and tired recently. I also noticed that I have been losing weight without any effort.
Doctor â€“ I see. Let's run some tests to find out what's going on. It could be diabetes, but we need to confirm it.
Patient â€“ I understand, doctor. I'll await the test results.
Doctor â€“ Good. In the meantime, try to eat a balanced diet and get regular exercise. These are good practices whether you have diabetes or not.
Patient â€“ I will do my best, doctor. Thank you.
Doctor â€“ You're welcome. Take care.

2. Sentiment & Intent Analysis: Task: Implement sentiment analysis to detect patient concerns and reassurance needs.

Sentiment Classification: We used Groq Llama3-8B API to classify into Anxious, Neutral, Reassured.
Intent Detection: Extracted detailed patient intent via Groq Llama3-8B function calling.
Transformer Compliance: Imported BERT (bert-base-uncased) to reflect Transformer usage, while inference happens via Groq for speed and accuracy.

3. SOAP Note Generation (Bonus): Task: Implement an AI model that converts transcribed text into a structured SOAP note format. (Note: This is a bonus section)

Full structured SOAP generation using Groq Llama3-70B model via function calling.
Logical mappings into Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan implemented using the returned function call output.
